## **Digital Clock Application: Design Document**

### 1. Overview

This document outlines the design and functionality of a web-based digital clock application. The application's primary function is to display the current time, updated every second, in a clear `HH:MM:SS` format. It is built using standard web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior.

### 2. Core Components

The application consists of three main files:

* **`index.html`**: Provides the basic structure of the web page, including the container element where the clock is displayed.
* **`style.css`**: Defines the visual appearance of the clock, including layout, typography, colors, and responsive design. It also includes support for both light and dark color schemes.
* **`app.js`**: Contains the logic for the clock's functionality, such as fetching the current time and updating the display every second.


### 3. How It Works

**HTML Structure (`index.html`)**
The HTML file sets up the basic page, including a `div` element with the ID `digital-clock`. This element serves as the target for the JavaScript to inject the live time display. The initial text "00:00:00" acts as a placeholder before the JavaScript loads.

**Styling (`style.css`)**
The CSS file provides a modern and responsive design for the clock.

* **Layout**: The clock is centered vertically and horizontally on the page using Flexbox.
* **Theming**: It uses CSS variables for colors, fonts, and spacing, making the theme easily customizable. It includes styles for a `clock-container` and a `.clock-display` for the time itself.
* **Dark Mode**: The design automatically adapts to the user's system preference for light or dark mode using the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` query.
* **Typography**: A monospaced font is used for the clock display to ensure uniform character width, which prevents the layout from shifting as the numbers change.
* **Responsiveness**: Media queries are used to adjust font sizes and padding for smaller screens, ensuring the clock is legible on mobile devices and desktops.

**JavaScript Functionality (`app.js`)**
The application's logic is encapsulated within a `DigitalClock` class, which manages the clock's state and behavior.

1. **Initialization**:
    * When the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) is fully loaded, a new instance of the `DigitalClock` class is created.
    * The class constructor identifies the `<div id="digital-clock">` element in the HTML and calls the `init()` method.
2. **Time Display and Updates**:
    * The `init()` method immediately calls `updateTime()` to show the current time without delay, then calls `startClock()`.
    * `startClock()` uses `setInterval` to execute the `updateTime()` function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
    * The `updateTime()` function gets the current time from `getCurrentTime()` and sets the `textContent` of the clock element to this new value.
3. **Time Formatting**:
    * The `getCurrentTime()` function creates a `new Date()` object to get the system's current time.
    * It extracts the hours, minutes, and seconds. Each unit is passed to the `formatTimeUnit()` helper function.
    * `formatTimeUnit()` ensures each number is two digits by adding a leading zero if the number is less than 10 (e.g., `7` becomes `07`).
    * The function then returns a formatted string, such as `14:08:09`.
4. **Accuracy and Robustness**:
    * An event listener is attached to the document's `visibilitychange` event. If the user navigates to another tab and then returns, this listener calls `updateTime()` immediately to correct any potential drift that occurred while the tab was inactive.
    * The code includes methods to `stopClock()` and `restartClock()`, allowing for programmatic control over the clock's interval.
